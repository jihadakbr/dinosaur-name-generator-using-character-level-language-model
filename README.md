# Dinosaur Name Generator using Character-Level Language Model

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Objective

As the task leader, I am responsible for naming newly created breeds of dinosaurs. To achieve this, I will use deep learning to build a character-level language model with an RNN. The model will learn name patterns and generate novel dinosaur names. By completing this assignment, I aim to store text data, construct the language model, sample new sequences, understand gradient issues in RNNs, and apply gradient clipping for stability. My goal is to provide safe and creative names, keeping the team and dinosaurs content. Let's begin with provided functions in rnn_utils, such as rnn_forward and rnn_backward, for this exciting journey!
